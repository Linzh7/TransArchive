The Chinese Communist Party is undertaking a horrifying effort to eradicate “transgenderism” from public life, banning hormone replacement therapy and expelling trans students from schools. One trans woman describes 58 friends dying by suicide in 40 days.

Thanks for your voice. As a trans person from China very familiar with&active in the local trans community (and escaped very recently), I confirm that, though the info is not completely accurate, the condition of trans ppl in China are deteriorating rapidly. Some recent events:

Too long in a tweet so I made a screenshot. In short,
1. Hormone ban is real;
1. Now trans ppl will lose their diploma;
1. Anti-trans propaganda and police actions;
1. Conversion therapists everywhere;
1. Progression exists, but limited;
1. Authority will never admit their goal.
